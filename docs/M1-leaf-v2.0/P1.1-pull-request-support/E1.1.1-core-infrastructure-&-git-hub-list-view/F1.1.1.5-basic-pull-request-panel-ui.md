# F1.1.1.5: Basic PullRequestPanel UI

**Description:**
Create PullRequestPanel UserControl with PR list on left (filter bar, ListBox), empty details area on right, and integrate into MainWindow layout alongside CommitDetail and DiffViewer.

**Technical Approach:**
1. Create PullRequestPanel.xaml with Grid layout (350px left column, splitter, * right column)
2. Add filter bar with ComboBox for status (Open/Closed/Merged/All) and TextBox for search
3. Add ListBox with virtualization for PR list, bound to PullRequests collection
4. Create DataTemplate for PR items: #Number, Title, Author avatar, draft badge, date
5. Add empty placeholder for details panel (populated in E1.1.2)
6. Create PullRequestPanel.xaml.cs with basic code-behind
7. Update MainWindow.xaml to include PullRequestPanel with visibility binding to IsPullRequestPanelVisible
8. Add inverse visibility on CommitDetailView when PR panel is visible
9. Ensure DiffViewer overlays both panels
10. Follow existing Leaf dark theme colors (#1C2024, #202428, etc.)
- **User Impact:** Visual interface to browse and select PRs; consistent with existing Leaf aesthetic
- **Technical Value:** Foundation UI structure for detailed features in E1.1.2

### US-1: Browse Pull Requests

**User Story:**
> As a developer, I want to browse the list of pull requests and filter by status so that I can quickly find the PR I need.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I open PR panel, when there are open PRs, then I see them listed with number, title, and author
2. Given I select "Closed" filter, when the list updates, then only closed PRs display
3. Given I type in search box, when I enter author name, then list filters to matching PRs
4. Given a PR is draft, when viewing list, then draft indicator is visible
